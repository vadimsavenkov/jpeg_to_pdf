      "\n",
      "This chapter provides additional guidance to the Petroleum Resources Management System\n",
      "(PRMS) § 4.1 and § 4.2 regarding the application of the three broad categories of deterministic\n",
      "analytical procedures for estimating the range of recoverable quantities of oil and gas. These\n",
      "categories are: analogy, volumetric analysis, and production performance analysis methods, which\n",
      "include material balance, reservoir simulation, decline curve analysis, and other techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inthe early days of a project’s life when the project may not have advanced much beyond the\n",
      "development plan, modeling generally will be simple (such as through the use of analogs or\n",
      "volumetric analysis) and then gradually increase in complexity as the project matures. Depending\n",
      "on the scale of the investment, it is not uncommon to have advanced models available (even full-\n",
      "scale reservoir simulations) and ready at sanction, However, it is more common to see a\n",
      "progression of these models throughout the life of the project as the evaluating entity gathers more\n",
      "data and information about the reservoirs being produced. Once the project is fully mature, and\n",
      "only little further investment (financial and/or data acquisition) is anticipated, evaluators may use\n",
      "simpler models such as decline analysis, which rely mainly on the production performance of\n",
      "existing wells,\n",
      "\n",
      "If the project is incremental (PRMS § 2.3.0.1) to an already existing project (with an existing\n",
      "resource recovery estimate already attached, often referred to as the base profile), it is important\n",
      "to evaluate the resources for the addition and the existing project together (to take into account\n",
      "effets such as interference amongst wells or back-pressure effect in the production facility) and\n",
      "to compare the resulting profile with the base profile. Sometimes an incremental project will\n",
      "accelerate the production of resources from the base profile, but the acceleration may be\n",
      "accompanied by a deceleration (relative to the base profile) at later time. This is generally a\n",
      "positive situation because it improves the economics, but only the added resources (difference\n",
      "between the total profile and the base profile) of the new project should be counted in the PRMS\n",
      "matrix when booking reserves and resources. Care must also be taken if incremental projects are\n",
      "booked as additive to a base profile/project because these projects may not be independent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simpler models used for estimation of resources during the early phases of a project (such as\n",
      "exploration, appraisal, and sometimes initial development periods) can be derived by estimating\n",
      "initially in-place volumes using static-data-based volumetric methods and the associated recovery\n",
      "efficiency derived from analog development projects, or by using analytical methods. As these\n",
      "models generally are not very detailed, their execution may require less computer power and will\n",
      "therefore be a relatively quick exercise. Itis common to incorporate these early efforts into multiple\n",
      "models or scenarios, whether deterministic or probabilistic (please see Chapter 7—Probabilistic\n",
      "Resources Estimation for further details).\n",

      "\n",
      "The PRMS accepts two deterministic approaches to resource/reserves estimation: the\n",
      "“incremental” and the “scenario” (or “cumulative”) methods (PRMS § 4.2.1.1). When both are\n",
      "applied to the same project, they should arrive at comparable results (PRMS § 2.2.2.1), especially\n",
      "when aggregated to the field level; they are simply different ways of thinking about the\n",
      "same problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the incremental approach, more emphasis is placed on the experience and professional\n",
      "judgment of the evaluator in the estimation of discrete quantities to be assigned to each category\n",
      "(e.g., Pl, P2, and P3 for incremental reserves). When performing volumetric analyses using the\n",
      "incremental approach, a single value is adopted for each parameter based on a well-defined\n",
      "description of the reservoir to determine the in-place resources, or reserves, volumes. This method\n",
      "works best when there is insignificant interference among the low, best, and high estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the scenario/cumulative approach, three separate analyses are prepared to bracket the\n",
      "uncertainty through sensitivity analysis (i.e., values estimated by three plausible sets of key input\n",
      "geoscience and engineering data parameters). These scenarios are designed to represent the low,\n",
      "best, and high realizations of original in-place volumes and associated recoverable petroleum\n",
      "quantities (PRMS § 2.2.1.4). Depending on the stage of commercial maturity, these scenarios\n",
      "underpin the PRMS categorization of Reserves (low, best, high or IP, 2P, 3P) and Contingent\n",

      "accumulations with petroleum potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantages of a deterministic approach are the following: It describes a specific case\n",
      "where physically inconsistent combinations of parameter values can be identified and removed\n",
      "(ie., the specific combination of static and dynamic parameters must physically exist); it is easier\n",
      "to prepare; it is easier to audit; and the approach has a history of use with estimates that generally\n",
      "can be reliable and reproducible.\n",

      "quantity of reliable data and degree of certainty in the estimates of PIIP and EUR are\n",
      "expected to increase over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "© Material balance methods rely upon pressure data gathered from wells. Ideally, collected\n",
      "data should have sufficiently long testing times to reach stabilized buildup pressures. For\n",
      "shorter shut-in durations, pressure points used for analysis should be the result of\n",
      "extrapolation from pressure transient analysis of the acquired data or a comparable\n",
      "correction method that can be used to estimate an appropriate stabilized pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "© A good practice when employing material balance is to first review reservoir pressure\n",
      "data as a function of time through use of a plot (see Appendix A to this chapter). This is\n",
      "especially helpful in low-permeability reservoirs, where pressures may not equilibrate\n",
      "throughout the whole reservoir, causing multiple trends to appear. In cases where\n",

      "uniform trend for the reservoir as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "© In gas material balance analysis, initial p/z trends may suggest a linear relationship, but\n",
      "care must be taken to understand the reservoir drive mechanism. Several drive\n",
      "mechanisms may cause significant deviation from a straight p/z relationship over the life\n",

      "caution is required around those assumptions due to the dynamic nature of compositions and\n",

      "A volatile oil analysis requires use of a modified form of the oil material balance, such as that\n",
      "presented by Walsh and Raghavan (1994). As reservoir pressure drops below the bubblepoint, and\n",
      "there is a release of gas, there will also be an amount of volatilized oil present in the gas. The MBE\n",

      "4A.4 Material Balance Pressure Data Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates of average reservoir pressure rely upon data gathered from wells. In an ideal situation,\n",
      "all pressure measurements taken and appropriately corrected would represent the true average\n",
      "reservoir pressure. This is generally a reasonable assumption for gas reservoirs where sufficiently\n",
      "long testing times have allowed for a stabilized buildup pressure to be measured. As a guideline,\n",
      "a pressure can be considered to be stable if evidenced by an increase in pressure of no more than\n",
      "2 kPa/hr (0.3 psi/hr) over a 6-hour period (Alberta Energy Regulator 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "For shorter shut-in durations, where pressures may not be stabilized, pressure points used for\n",
      "analysis should be the result of extrapolation from pressure transient analysis of the acquired data\n",
      "or a comparable method, to estimate an equivalent stabilized pressure. If there is no evidence\n",
      "provided of the length of shut-in of pressure data, a wider range of uncertainty should be\n",
      "considered to encompass the possibility of insufficiently built up pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "All pressure data should be appropriately corrected to a common datum depth, such as the\n",
      "reservoir midpoint in a well or the field-wide average depth of a reservoir. If wellhead pressure\n",
      "measurements are used, then they must be properly corrected to estimate reservoir pressures at the\n",
      "datum depth, considering fluid property variations that may occur throughout the length of the\n",
      "wellbore. A common method of wellhead-bottomhole pressure drop estimation is to divide the\n",

      "system on the surface and in the tubing string in the wellbore. A gas well will stop flowing when\n",
